# cb2 files decryption

I have no idea who wrote this code.


You should specify the path to your \StreamingAssets\AssetBundles folder in Program.cs.

After launching, a new folder will be created in \StreamingAssets\AssetBundles, the files inside can be opened with https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio.
